# Helpers

Helper functions are immutable Javascript functions. They are deterministic: With the same inputs, they will _always_ return the same output.

We try to make helper functions whenever possible in order to provide a store of knowledge we can share across projects.

## Testing

Helper functions are easy to test in contrast to others. Ideally, we use Jest (already installed) in order to test helper functions.
