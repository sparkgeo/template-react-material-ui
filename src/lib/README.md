# Lib Directory

The Lib directory contains all methods and tools that can't be broken down into pure, immutable functions. API call abstraction, colour generation, anything random; These are all things lib functions can do.


## Structure

The structure of this directory is less terse than that of Helpers or Components. Do what feels right.

## Testing

Testing lib files should be done via integration testing, and under as realistic circumstances as possible. This is one area for improvement in the team.
